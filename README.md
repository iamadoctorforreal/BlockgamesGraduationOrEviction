I have to explain my sleepless nights

I am stackless, neither frontend nor backend just 'learningend'.

I like knowing how things work and replicate same, but I am too slow.


<h2>Project 1</h2>


https://github.com/IhuomaO/Nestcoin-buterin

In this team I worked with the frontend. I was given the task to connect the DApp to metamask and retrieve the user's address and balance.

I was able to connect to metamask and retrieve the user's address, but not the balance unfortunately.

This might seem like a little, but it took a plethora of videos to get this, my experience with react is minute, the first and last time I worked with it was also for a project in 2020.

And solidity has been dealing with me, but contracts are beautiful when they work.

In case you are unaware my connection to metamask and  retrieval of the user's address was the closest we got our UI interacting with our smart contract by presentation day.

I put myself up for eviction into probation, because I felt, connecting to metamask was rather a super minute contribution, everybody else who was active was either good at react or smart contract.

I wish I could work with the smart contract instead, but I am glad I worked with the frontend, I would never have known how difficult it was just connecting to the smart contract from the UI.







<h2>Project 2</h2>

https://github.com/Team-ImmortalBlocks/NestcoinLibraryChallenge


In this team I worked on the frontend and subsequently with documentation, I did'nt want the same thing that happened in my team to happen here, which was inability to connect the smart contract to the UI, but it happened again.

This time I let my team lead know my react skill paucity, and I also told him that connecting to the UI was more important than the UI. I also stressed that the real react guy on the frontend team and me were finding it difficult to link our UI to the smart contract. Well, they gave links and videos to watch, well, at deadline,we still couldn't connect to the smart contract.

It looks like a curse, every team I am in, we can connect the UI to the smart contract.
In case you want to know what I did during this time, I have repositories I created to practice and understand how it works.

I followed a whole tutorial, and I was able to interact with an ECR20 token smart contract from the UI.
The problem was, ours is a custom smart contract and I still had to interact with IPFS.

Not enough time for my slow brain to put it all together.
