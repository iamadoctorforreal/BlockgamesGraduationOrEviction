I have to explain my sleepless nights

I am stackless, neither frontend nor backend just 'learningend'.

I like knowing how things work and replicate same, but I am too slow.

In this team I worked with the frontend. I was given the task to connect the DApp to metamask and retrieve the user's address and balance.

I was able to connect to metamask and retrieve the user's address, but not the balance unfortunately.

This might seem like a little, but it took a plethora of videos to get this, my experience with react is minute, the first and last time I worked with it was also for a project in 2020.

And solidity has been dealing with me, but contracts are beautiful when they work.

In case you are unaware my connection to metamask and  retrieval of the user's address was the closest we got our UI interacting with our smart contract by presentation day.

I put myself up for eviction into probation, because I felt, connecting to metamask was rather a super minute contribution, everybody else who was active was either good at react or smart contract.

I wish I could work with the smart contract instead, but I am glad I worked with the frontend, I would never have known how difficult it was jut connecting to the smart contract from the UI.
